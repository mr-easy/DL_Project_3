**Deep Learning Course Project 3**

**Natural Language Inference on SNLI**

To run the code:

- For training MLP: 

	```python train_mlp.py```
- For training CNN: 

	```python train_cnn.py```
- For testing
	
	```python main.py```
	
  - This will create two text files "tfidf.txt" and "deep_model.txt" containing prediction of each test sample in one line for both the classifiers.
